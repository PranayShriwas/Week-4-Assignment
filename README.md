# Week's Task Overview:

1. Understanding Requirements: Begin by understanding the requirements of the Conversational AI application, including integrating the OpenAI model, ensuring relevant responses, and implementing database storage.

2. Setting Up Development Environment: Ensure that Python, Flask, psycopg2, OpenAI, and textblob are installed in the development environment.

3. Implementing Flask Application: Create the Flask application (`app.py`) to handle HTTP requests, interact with the database, and communicate with the OpenAI model.

4. Integration with OpenAI: Implement the integration with OpenAI for generating responses to user input.

5. Sentiment Analysis Module: Develop the sentiment analysis module (`sentiment_analysis_module.py`) to analyze the sentiment of generated responses using OpenAI.

6. Database Integration: Implement the database integration module (`vector_database_module.py`) to store user input, AI responses, and sentiment analysis results in a PostgreSQL database.

7. Documentation and Testing: Write documentation for the application, including installation instructions and a user guide. Test the application thoroughly to ensure it meets requirements.

# Today's Assignment & Assessment:

- Task: Finalize the implementation of the Conversational AI application, including integrating the OpenAI model, ensuring relevant responses, implementing database storage, and writing documentation.
  
- Assessment Focus:
  - Successful integration of the OpenAI model.
  - Relevance and quality of generated responses.
  - Quality of the written report and documentation.
  - Clarity and usability of the user guide.

# Challenges Faced and Accomplishments:

- Challenges:
  - Ensuring relevant and high-quality responses from the OpenAI model.
  - Handling errors and exceptions gracefully, especially with database interactions and API calls.

- Accomplishments:
  - Successful integration of the OpenAI model into the Flask application.
  - Implementation of sentiment analysis for analyzing response sentiment.
  - Integration with PostgreSQL for database storage.
  - Thorough testing and debugging of the application to ensure functionality.

# How to Run the Application:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip (`requirements.txt`).
3. Set up a PostgreSQL database with the appropriate schema (`conversations` table).
4. Update the PostgreSQL connection parameters in `app.py` and `vector_database_module.py` to match your database configuration.
5. Set the OpenAI API key in `app.py` and `sentiment_analysis_module.py`.
6. Run the Flask application using `python app.py`.
7. Access the application in a web browser at the specified address (typically `http://localhost:5000`).
